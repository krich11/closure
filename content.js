/**
 * Closure — Content Script (content.js)
 * @version 1.4.0
 *
 * DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used.
 *
 * As of v1.4.0, Closure operates without host_permissions or the
 * scripting permission. All AI inference runs through the offscreen
 * document (offscreen/offscreen.js), and all tab analysis uses
 * chrome.tabs metadata (title, URL, status) instead of injecting
 * content scripts into web pages.
 *
 * This file is retained for reference only.
