## Detailed Description (CWS listing — paste into Developer Dashboard)

Closure is a privacy-first tab manager that eliminates browser guilt. It automatically organizes your tabs, catches broken pages, and archives what you're not using — with AI-generated summaries so nothing is ever truly lost.

🔒 100% LOCAL — ZERO DATA COLLECTION
Every byte of data stays on your device. No servers, no analytics, no telemetry, no tracking. Closure makes zero network requests. Your browsing data is yours alone.

✦ CLEAN SLATE AUTOMATOR
Open 3+ tabs from the same site? They're automatically grouped into a labeled, color-coded, collapsed group. Your tab bar stays clean without you lifting a finger. Threshold is adjustable from 3 to 10.

✦ AI TOPIC GROUPING
Goes beyond domains — uses Chrome's built-in on-device Gemini Nano to group tabs by content. A Stack Overflow answer, a blog post, and a GitHub issue about "React hooks" get grouped together, even though they're from different sites. Runs on a schedule or on-demand.

✦ DEAD END SWEEPER
Every 60 minutes, Closure scans for broken tabs — 404s, 500 errors, DNS failures, timed-out pages, and tabs that never finished loading. It logs them for your reference and quietly closes them.

✦ GRACEFUL EXIT
Tabs you haven't touched in 24 hours (configurable: 4h–168h) are archived with a 3-bullet AI summary preserving key facts, dates, and action items. Before closing, a "Stay of Execution" overlay gives you 10 minutes to keep the tab or snooze it. If Chrome's AI engine isn't available, the title, URL, and first 500 characters are saved instead.

✦ SUNDAY DIGEST
A dashboard of everything archived — grouped by domain or clustered by AI-detected themes. Each entry shows the favicon, linked title, summary, and timestamp. Restore individual tabs or entire groups with one click.

✦ ZEN POPUP
A quick-glance health ring (green/yellow/red based on tab count), a "nuclear" button to archive all idle tabs at once, and running stats on tabs tidied and estimated RAM saved.

✦ SAFETY NET
Pinned tabs and tabs playing audio are never touched. Whitelist any domain to make it fully immune. Works across all windows.
